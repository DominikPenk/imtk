# ImTk

This project tries to implement an immediate GUI framework with a similar API to [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for Tkinter.


## TODOS
- [x] Scrolling for ImFrame
- [x] Add a window implementation
- [x] Tick and Callback mode for calling *refresh*
- [ ] Split [functions.py](imtk/functional.py) into multiple files
- [ ] An actually useful README and docs :-)
- [ ] Rework scrolling (I think using a canvas should be better)
